Improvements and practice of HTML and CSS skills.

This is a coding project I did to improve my current skills. I used twitter bootstrap, isotope jQuery plugin and Sass. The main goal of this project was for me to get comfortable with creating bussiness-like landing page that included cross browser compatibility and responsiveness. Works in IE9, IE10, IE11 and other modern browsers.
