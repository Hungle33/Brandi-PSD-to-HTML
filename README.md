# Brandi-PSD-to-HTML

Improvements and practice of HTML and CSS skills.

This is a coding project I did to improve my current skills. I used twitter bootstrap, Masonry jQuery plugin and Sass. The main goal of this project was to get comfortable with creating bussiness-like landing page with functionality and responsiveness.
